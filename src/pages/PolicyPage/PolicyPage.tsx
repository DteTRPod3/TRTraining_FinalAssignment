                policy. The law&apos;s reach stretches well beyond California to
                require any person or company in the United States (and
                conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting
                Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to
                post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly
                the information being collected and those individuals or
                companies with whom it is being shared.{" "}

                what operators of websites and online services must do to
